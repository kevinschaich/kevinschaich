### Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the last 3 years solving awesome problems at [Palantir](https://palantir.com), working with clients in the fianancial services, automotive manufacturing, national defense, and oil & gas industries. In my free time I build open-source software, most recently [Mintable](https://github.com/kevinschaich/mintable), a free tool which allows developers everywhere to manage & automate their personal finances.

I grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania dabbling in everything from action sports to musical instruments to [landscape](https://instagram.com/kevinschaich) and [city](https://instagram.com/skyline.patrol) photography. I studied CS at Cornell and spent some time as an intern at [Workday](https://workday.com) in 2015 and [Shopkick](https://shopkick.com) in 2016. These days, I fill the weekends with skiing/snowboarding during the cold months and road trips/hiking during the warm months.
