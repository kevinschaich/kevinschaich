### Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the last 3 years solving awesome problems at [Palantir](https://palantir.com). I've worked with clients in the fianancial services, automotive manufacturing, national defense, and oil & gas industries. In my free time I'm an open-source junkie, most recently working on [Mintable](https://github.com/kevinschaich/mintable), a free, open source tool allowing developers everywhere to manage their finances.

I grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania dabbling in everything from action sports to musical instruments to [landscape](https://instagram.com/kevinschaich) and [city](https://instagram.com/skyline.patrol) photography. I went to Cornell and studied Computer Science, spending some time as an intern at [Workday](https://workday.com) in 2015 and [Shopkick](https://shopkick.com) in 2016. These days, I fill the weekends with skiing/snowboarding during the cold months and road trips/hiking during the warm months.
