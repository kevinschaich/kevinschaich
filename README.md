### Hi, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

I've spent the last 5 years solving awesome problems at [Palantir](https://palantir.com), working with clients in the aviation, telecommunications, financial services, automotive manufacturing, national defense, and oil & gas industries. In my free time I build open-source software, most notably [Mintable](https://github.com/kevinschaich/mintable), a free tool which allows developers everywhere to manage & automate their personal finances.

I grew up in the suburbs near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania dabbling in everything from action sports to [music](https://soundcloud.com/stowiq) to [photography](https://www.instagram.com/kevinschaich/). I studied CS at Cornell and spent some time as an intern at [Workday](https://workday.com) in 2015 and [Shopkick](https://shopkick.com) in 2016. Outside of work I'm an avid [cyclist/runner/skier](https://www.strava.com/athletes/kevinschaich), road tripper, guitarist, and aspiring podcast listener.

2022 goals include a 50+ mile bike ride (done), running a 5k (done), and learning more about piano, guitar, music theory, and electronic production (in progress).

Talk to me about [photography](https://instagram.com/kevinschaich) / [cameras](https://instagram.com/kevinschaich) / gadgets, [personal finance](https://github.com/kevinschaich/mintable), your morning Chemex routine, cars (& Top Gear), and your favorite cold open on The Office.
